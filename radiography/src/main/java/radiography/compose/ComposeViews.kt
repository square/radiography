  // array that stores a flattened version of a composition tree) is super low level. It's likely to
  // change a lot between compose versions, and keeping up with that with every two-week dev release
  // would be a lot of work. Additionally, a lot of the objects stored in the slot table are not
  // public (eg LayoutNode), so we'd need to use even more (brittle) reflection to do that parsing.
